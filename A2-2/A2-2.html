	I was struggling to lose weight after the birth of my second child. My friend recommended NewYou,and <br /> after the
	first three months I had lost 30 pounds. Thanks to the personal attention from their trainers <br /> and counselors,
	I've been able to keep the weight off for two years. I'm in the best shape of my life! <br />

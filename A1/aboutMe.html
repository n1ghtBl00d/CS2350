			<h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
			<p>My name is Zach Lore. I am a senior at NUAMES Early College High School. I am currently persuing 
			an Associates of Computer Science. I am an Eagle Scout. I love electronics and computers. My favorite
			foods are lasagna, popcorn, and fresh bread. My preferred operating systems are Windows and Android.

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>I have many hobbies, but most of them can be sorted into 2 categories:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Indoor Hobbies</li>
			<li>Outdoor Hobbies</li>
		</ul>
		<br /> 
		<h3>Indoor Hobbies</h3>
		<div>
			<p style="font-size:18px">Reading</p>
			<p>I have loved reading for most of my life. All through elementary school, I read incessantly. I 
			always had a book to read. I would even read through class. It got to the point that my teacher took
			me aside and told me that I read too much.</p>
			<p>My favorite genres are fantasy and science fiction. I mostly read fantasy books, though i will most 
			read anything that keeps my attention. What draws me into a book and keeps me interested are things like 
			interesting and well-defined magic systems (Anything  by Brandon Sanderson), thought provoking questions,
			situations, or other elements (<i>I, Robot</i> by Issac Asimov or <i>Xenocide</i> by Orson Scott Card),
			and a rich, well-built world with lots of intrigue and sub-plots to explore (<b>The Wheel of Time</b> 
			Series by Robert Jordan).
			<p>My Favorite Book Series Are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>The Stormlight Archive</b> by Brandon Sanderson</li>
				<li><b>The Ender Saga</b> by Orson Scott Card</li>
				<li><b>The Wheel of Time</b> by Robert Jordan</li>
				<li><b>Mistborn</b> by Brandon Sanderson</li>
				<li><b>The Hunger Games</b> by Suzanne Collins</li>
			</ol>

		<div>
			<p style="font-size:18px">Robotics</p>
			<p>Robotics is the hobby I devote the most time to. I have been an active member of my school's FRC 
			Robotics team for 3 years. I recently also joined a team in a second robotics league: Vex Robotics. I also
			persue smaller robotics and other elecronics projects in my free time at home.
			</p>			
			<p>My first year of high school, I joined the school robotics team. I decided to be in the Programming 
			Department. It was rough starting out, as I had almost no prior experience with programming and our 
			captain didn't know how to teach it. I caught on and quickly became one of the major contributors in our
			department.
			</p>
			<p>The next year I switched and helped start a new department: Research and Development. I enjoyed R&amp;D 
			more than programming, as it was more hands on and we worked on projects that included work in the fields 
			of all the other departments. R&amp;D was in charge of all the oddball assignments and upkeep of our robots 
			from previous years.
			</p>
			<p>Now, I am the captain of Research and Development. It is a major time commitment. We have 1-2 team 
			meetings each week, and there are also often meetings for all the captains of the different departments
			in addition. During the Build Season, which begins in early January and lasts 6 weeks, we meet every day 
			except sundays to build our robot. The year's challenge is announced the first day of Build season, and 
			we have 6 weeks to strategize, design, develop, build, and test our robot. We have to stop at the end of
			the 6 weeks and then go to competition. Our meetings during build season usually last for 3-6 hours.

		<h3>Outdoor Hobbies</h3>
		<div>
			<p style="font-size:18px">Quadcopters and R/C Vehicles.</p>
			<p>I love building and flying quadcopters, planes, and cars (though the cars often have trouble flying).
			This hobby could be considered an indoor hobby, as most of my time is spent indoors building, repairing, 
			and maintaining my vehicles, I don't consider it to be. The best parts are outdoors. My love of Robotics
			and my love of R/C vehicles and other things that fly build upon each other. I use much the same skillset
			for both and tools.
			</p>
			<p>My interest started young, with a christmas gift of some R/C cars when I was little. We enjoyed them 
			for years. Later, my dad got us some cheap R/C helicopters, and I enjoyed them before they were destroyed.
			I eventually got a R/C plane, and learned something inportant:
			<blockquote>&quot;Owning a model plane does not a pilot make&quot;
			<p style="text-align:center">-anonymous internet commenter</p>	
			</blockquote>		
			After I started Robotics, I again got interested in R/C flying vehicles again, though now I fly quadcopters
			rather than planes.
			</p>
			<p>My largest, hardest, and funnest project has been my full-size quadcopter. I ordered everything myself 
			and assembled it from scratch. It is rather large and it has an autopilot capable of autonomous waypoint
			based flight. It is my pride and joy as well as my black hole of time and money.
			</p>

		<div>
			<p style="font-size:18px">Camping and Backpacking</p>
			<p>When I was little, my parents instilled in me a love of the outdoors. We have gone camping often for as
			long as I can remember. We go out most weekends throughout the spring and fall, and I usually spend more 
			than half of my summer at some camp or another. 
			</p>
			<p>Most of my camping since I have been old enough has been through the Boy Scouts of America. My father
			is a firm believer in the value of scouting, and has been an adult leader in my troops. He has taken me on
			more scout outings than I can count. I have loved my time as a scout, and I too value the many things 
			scouting has taught me.
			</p>
			<p>My enjoyment of scouting led me to serve 2 summers on staff at a Scout Camp. Camp Loll is situated 
			between Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. It is in the middle of the largest tract of pristine
			wilderness in the continental U.S. It is, in my opinion, the most beautiful place on earth. Those 2 
			summers were the best summers of my life.
